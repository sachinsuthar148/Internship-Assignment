      <h3 id="question">Who is Web developer?</h3>
      <p id="answer">Web developers create the layout of a website, such as a visually appealing home page and a user-friendly design (frontend which is seen by the user), and they may also produce content for it. Developers ensure that a website is functioning on all web browsers after it is launched, testing and updating it as needed. A server, an application, and a database make up a website’s back end. A back-end developer creates and maintains the technology that enables the components that allow the website’s user-facing side to actually exist. They also use databases (a database is an organized collection of data) as they support better data access.</p>
